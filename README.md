# Marathon Report - Tung Dang - North East Marathon Analysis

# 1.Overview

This repository contains the analysis and deliverables for the North East Marathon Analysis, conducted by Duc Tung Dang (Liam). The project aims to explore runner performance, gender insights, training patterns, and develop a multiple linear regression model to predict marathon times.

# 2.Background & Goals

Objective: Analyze runner demographics, club membership, training habits, and build a predictive model to understand factors influencing marathon performance.

Approach: Utilizes statistical analysis and visualizations to study runner data, followed by a multiple linear regression model.

# 3.Executive Summary

Key Findings: Males outperform females in average positions, with the 20-40 age group dominating participation (8,689 runners). Club membership and personal trainers enhance performance, while training frequency correlates with better race positions and speed.

Recommendations: Encourage club participation, provide access to personal trainers, and promote consistent training to improve overall runner performance.

# 4.Data Insights

Dataset: 14,514 runners, with age distribution peaking at 20-40 (8,689), median race time around 6,000 seconds, and average BMI of 22.49.

Performance Trends: Higher training frequency (Trained IM) correlates with lower positions, while BMI decreases with better rankings.

# 5.Report Sections

General Information: Details gender distribution (5 females, 10 males), age groups, race time statistics, and BMI by position.

Club Membership Insights: Highlights performance benefits of club affiliation and barriers to joining.

Runnerâ€™s Gender Insights: Shows males achieving higher positions and training more frequently than females.

Training Insights: Analyzes training frequency, heart rate, speed, and their impact on performance across age groups and marathon experience.

Multiple Linear Regression Model: Predicts marathon time using variables like speed, VO2_max, and heart rate, with a residual plot indicating potential model refinements.

# 6.Library Use

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Employed for numerical computations and array operations.

Matplotlib: Utilized for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: Applied for statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): Leveraged for regression modeling and evaluation metrics.

statsmodels.api: Used for statistical modeling and regression analysis.

# 8. Tool use

Python, Tableau, Figma
